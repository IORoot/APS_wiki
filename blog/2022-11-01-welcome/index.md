The housequests application was born from starting my journey on purchasing my first home. 

I've quickly realised that bouncing around mulitple property websites and searching for what I wanted became more and more tedious. With weird filtering systems, truncated results, limited settings and non-existing features there must be a better way.

<!--truncate-->

The core of the project was to really just get a single map with all markers from the three main property sites and then build more features on top. The most pressing of features was the ability to exclude or blacklist. Being able to remove any property from the map forever has been fantastic. To see only the properties you've marked as favourites and any new ones has been the killer feature.

Next, I wanted overlays. Mostly the tube map and tube stations I had to scour the internet for this data and add the ability to toggle it on/off. The number of overlays inevitably grew too. The results are mostly from OpenStreetMap data and therefore may not be absolutely complete, but it's a whole lot better than nothing.

Now the application has grown to a very useful state and I've decided it's worth something to others. So, this is why this website was born and an authentication system was put into place. 

Hopefully you like it and enjoy the experience as much as I am!
