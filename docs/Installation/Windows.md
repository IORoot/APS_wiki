# 🪟 Windows

1. To get started, you need to download the correct version. Head over to the [downloads](/downloads) page and click on the latest Windows download.

2. Once you have downloaded the file, it will be an `.exe` file. Something like `HouseQuests-0.1.17-arm64.exe`. Double-click to open it.

3. Windows may complain about it being downloaded from the internet, dismiss and open anyway.

4. The application will install itself into your start menu and open automatically. Double-click to start it.

## 🏗 Architecture

HouseQuests is built using Electron, among other things. This makes it very reliable and versatile with multiple operating systems, including macOS, Windows and Linux.
