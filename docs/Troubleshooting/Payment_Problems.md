# ðŸ’³ Payment Problems

## My card won't work.

You will receive an email if you have problems with your payment method. This will be either because of a failed payment or the payment requires further action (Like 3DSecure).  All payment issues are handled through stripe and not HouseQuests and therefore, you should visit the stripe portal to access your dashboard.

## I haven't received any emails.

All emails are automatically generated through our server and will come from `andy@housequests.com`. Please check:

- You are using the correct email address and you have registered with the correct email address. This will be the one you used for your stripe payment.

- The email has not been filtered into a folder in your email client.

- The email has not been marked as spam automatically by your email client. Check the spam folder.

- The email has not been deleted or removed. Check the trash or bin folder of your email client.
