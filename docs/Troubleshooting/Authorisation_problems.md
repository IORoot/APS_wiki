# 🔐 Authorisation Problems

## I've forgotten my authorisation code.

Unfortunately, we cannot recover your 64-character authorisation code because we do not store it on our servers. A new authorisation code will have to be generated for your account and there is a charge for every time that task needs to be done. 

The current cost of generating a new code, updating the database and supplying you with that new code securely is £25. 

Please contact us if you need to generate a new code.


## My authorisation code doesn't work in the application.

Please check the following:

- The email address is correct and the same one you used for your stripe subscription.

- You have copied and pasted the code exactly from the email sent to you. Ensure there is no whitespace (extra space characters) at the front or end.

- Ensure you do not have a space or any other character in the textbox before you paste in the code.

- Make sure your subscription is active and running.
