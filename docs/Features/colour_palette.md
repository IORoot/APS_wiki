# 🎨 Colour Palette

`Right drawer > Property > Marker Colour`

The colour palette allows you to save your own colours for future use. You can also import and export entire custom palettes.

## #️⃣ Hexcodes

You can enter a colour hex code and click the `set marker` to change the current maker to that colour.
However, you can save that colour to the palette by clicking the `Add to palette` button.

Now the palette is populated with custom colours, you can select that colour by clicking on it, or delete any one by clicking on the `X` button.

You can use most online colour websites to find the HEX code of the colour.

## ↔️ Import / Export Palette

`Left Drawer > Admin > Import / Export Settings`

You can use the `import colour palette` and `export colour palette` buttons to manipulate and control the in-app palette. The file is a simple `JSON` array that can be changed if needed.
