If you have decided and purchased (thank you!) a subscription to HouseQuests, then you'll need both the email address you registered the subscription with and the authentication code that was automatically emailed to that address once you had subscribed. 

> Note: The authentication code is a machine-generated private encryption key that no other human has seen. Your key is **NOT** stored in our database - The other half of the encryption pair is held on our server. This means that we cannot recover the code for you. As a metaphor, we hold the padlock, you hold the key. We cannot tell you what the key is, because we don't store it.

### 🔑 Access

Put your email address and 64-character authentication code into the correct text areas (Make SURE both are typed correctly. Best to copy and paste the code from the email we sent you.
Then press the `Access` button. This will contact our authentication server, look up your email address and try your key in our lock. If it succeeds then your application will be enabled with full features.

### 🏦 Manage Stripe Subscription.

We **DO NOT** hold any of your banking information or details. The only personal identifying information we contain in our database is your email address - used to send notification emails of any subscription changes and to authenticate your application.
