# 🎨 Marker Colour (Favourite) Properties

`Right drawer > Property > Marker Colour`

You can distinguish any properties you have interest in by changing their marker colours. This also helps to differentiate ones you want to keep on the map with new properties being added.

It also gives you the ability to categorise your markers. Maybe you wish to mark all of the freehold properties orange and all the leasehold properties black. Or you could change the colour based on importance.

## 👩‍🎨 Change the marker colour

`Right drawer > Property > Marker Colour > Colour tab`

Click on a property to open the right drawer up. At the top of the `Property` tab, the second button (in green) is `Marker Colour`. Click that to open up a modal to choose a colour.

You now have 8 different colours to choose from.

Click the colour you wish to change the marker to. The modal will close and the marker will change.
