`Right drawer > Preferences > Excluded IDs`

Please see the [Excluding](/docs/Features/excluding) page for more details on how to use this panel.

## 🖍 Text Highlighter

`Right drawer > Preferences > Text Highlighter`

One piece of desirable functionality when searching for properties is the ability to automatically highlight words in the description so that you can instantly see them. This helps for rapidly getting through more markers and excluding or favouriting each.

You can have either positive (green) or negative (red) words. When you click on a marker and the right-drawer opens, you will see any of these words highlighted in the description text of the property.

Also, any found words will also be listed at the top of the property panel on the right-drawer. (Located between the property price and photos)

### 🟩 Text Searcher - Positives

This is a comma separated list of words or combinations of words that you wish to highlight in green on the description. The words are trimmed of whitespace on the front and end, but any multiple words will be kept as-is.


### 🟥 Text Searcher - Negatives

This is a comma separated list of words or combinations of words that you wish to highlight in red on the description. The words are trimmed of whitespace on the front and end, but any multiple words will be kept as-is.


## 🌈 Map Colours

`Right drawer > Preferences > Map Colours`

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the map being a pre-supplied bitmap image, it is quite difficult to change elements of the map to any custom colours. However, filters can be applied to the entire map so that it effects the colours on a general level.

All icons are still coloured and not effected by the filters.

The following filters are available:

- Monochrome. Desaturate the map of all colour for a light greyscale map. 
- Invert. Reverse all map colours to a much darked version of the map.
- Dark. This will desaturate to remove all colours and then invert to make it dark.
- Sepia. Give a light-brown warm tint to the map.

## 🎚 Settings

`Right drawer > Preferences > Settings`

Toggle the intro panel on or off when the application is loaded or refreshed.
