Seeing train stations, bus routes, school locations and other essential information was a key feature that has been implemented into the application.

The following layers can be toggled on or off for the entire map:

## 🚇 London Tube Lines

## 🛤 London Train Lines

To complement the map, we have also included the colour-coded train lines within London. A straight dotted line that isn't geographically correct and doesn't follow the tracks exactly. These are from multiple different train services and clicking on the line will popup information that includes the service name for that particular section of track and the two stations it connects to.
