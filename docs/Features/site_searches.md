# Site Searches

The base requirement of the HouseQuests application was the ability to see properties from multiple online sources all on a single map. 

This what the multi-search does. It allows you to paste in the search URL from one of those sources and then creates a new layer on the map with those markers. 

We currently support the following sources:

- Zoopla.co.uk
- Rightmove.co.uk
- OnTheMarket.com

## Paste search


## Toggle markers

## Goto original

## Marker count

## Refresh Page
