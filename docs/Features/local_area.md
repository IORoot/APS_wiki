# 🏘 Local Area

`Right Drawer > Local Area`

The local area tab, on the right drawer allows you to request data from third-party sources (Like the Police, mapping services, etc...) and plot the data around the selected marker. To restrict the number of markers, the results are within a 1km (1000m) range. 

Note that the more markers and points you add to the map, the more your computer has to handle. So it's best to switch them off once used. 

You can refresh the page to clear all services.

All service icons and points are clickable. You can click the icon to load extra information.

Every service also has a toggle underneath to switch them on or off the map.
