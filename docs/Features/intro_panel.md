Opening up the app will initially present you with the introduction panel. It has some key information and functionality built in.

## 🆚 Versioning 
Firstly, the title at the top will contain the version number of the app. This follows typical `semver` versioning. Essentially v`major`.`minor`.`patch`.

You can check the [releases page](/releases) to see if you're up-to-date or not.

## 🔐 Authentication Code. 

This small section of the panel duplicates the one in the administration panel. See the [Authentication](/docs/Features/authentication) section for more details. 

A slight extra feature is that you will see an `Authenticated` (in green) or `Not Authenticated` (in red) message depending on your status.
## 🆕 New Features

The left-hand side of the intro panel will show the release message of the current version. This will give you a brief overview of the changes made in that version.

## 🔗 Quick Links

There are some quick links on the right side of the panel to help you get to some useful resources.


## 💀 Disabling the panel

`Right Drawer > Preferences > Settings > Disable intro panel`

If you prefer to switch off (or back on) the intro panel whenever you load the app or refresh the app, you can by using the toggle switch in the `Preferences` tab.
