# 👋 Hello! 

Congratulations on finding our little app. It's got a lot of little features, so let's discover the what the HouseQuests application can do, shall we.


## 🇬🇧 UK and London based.

This app is primarily targeted towards London and UK home buyers and renters. It's where we're based and was initially created just for us to use... This means that most map overlays, searches and features will only work within the UK for now. Depending on the popularity, there is potential room for expansion to overseas areas. 

The main reason for this is because the sources (Zoopla, Rightmove and OnTheMarket) only deal with the UK.

## 🏗 Wiki Structure

The documentation has been laid out to cover every feature as thoroughly and logically as possible. You may find some overlap in topics, but essentially, every section is a panel or menu in the application.

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

This is where known bugs and issues are held. Head over to this section to try to solve your problem. 
Otherwise, if you can't find what you're looking for, head over to our GitHub repository and submit an issue. We don't have a support team, but the community may be able to help.
