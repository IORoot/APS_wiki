# ðŸ’³ Purchasing

You can easily purchase a subscription for HouseQuests via the [pricing page](/pricing). Click on 'Subscribe' to be taken over to Stripe.com and the checkout portal. 

Using the stripe checkout portal means that we do not need to handle your bank details or personal information. That's all taken care of by stripe.

Put your details into the payment form and click the `Subscribe` button.

## ðŸ§¾ Invoices

Once you're on the subscription plan, Stripe will tell us that you've paid for the next month and to enable access. This will automatically happen every month. You'll receive an email saying you've paid for the next invoice.
